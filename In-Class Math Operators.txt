So here's the deal with math operators.

In math you have addition, subtraction, and all that.

In C# you also have these, but you have some more.

All the usual suspects behave as you'd expect...

2 + 4 = 6

4 - 2 = 2

4 * 2 = 8

4 / 2 = 2

But there's also some new ones.

++ adds one...so if A is 4 and I say A++; then A will be 5.

-- decreases one...so if A is 4 and I say A--; then A will be 3.

Now we also have comparative operators.

Equal, or =, is similar to these.

== checks if each side of the == is the same.

so...

A == A is true.
A == B is not true.
4 == 4 is true.
4 == 2 is not true.

See?

But we can do much more.

We can use != which checks if each side is NOT the same.

So...

A != A is not true.
A != B is true.
4 != 4 is not true.
4 != 2 is true.

See?

We can also use Greater Thans or Less Thans.

So...

4 > 2 is true.
2 > 4 is not true.
2 < 4 is true.
4 < 2 is not true.

We can also use Greater Than Or Equal Tos and vice versa.

4 >= 4 is true.
4 <= 4 is true.

Very useful stuff.
