So for my If Statements explanation...

I'll show some stuff from class.

		if(Name == "Dog") {
			print("Bark!");
		}
		if(Name == "Cat") {
			print("Meow!");
		}

Essentially, an If statement is exactly what you'd think it is.

"IF (the value of Name) is equal to "Dog" then I should print "Bark!""

It's a question you ask, and if the answer is what you say it should be, it does work. If it isn't, it doesn't. EZ PZ.
