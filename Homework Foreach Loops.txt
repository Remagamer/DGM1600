Homework: Foreach Loops

There are a lot of loops, but foreach works with arrays and lists in a unique way. It iterates over every item in the list the same way.

		foreach (var score in HighScores)
		{
			if (score >= 1000)
			{
				print(score);
			}
		}

so in this code sample, for every value (called score here) in the array HighScores, check if their value is above or equal to 1000, and if so print the value.

They're pretty cool that way.
