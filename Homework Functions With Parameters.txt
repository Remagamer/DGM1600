Homework Functions With Parameters.

The deal with functions that have parameters can act differently based on those parameters.

so I could say...

	AddMarios(int number)
	{
		Marios += number;
	}

...and that would add the specified amount of Marios.

With simple functions like that it seems lame, but when you get really powerful functions with similar functionality it is a thing of beauty.
