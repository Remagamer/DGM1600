So the dealio of Scope and Access Modifiers is this: when you define something, you can set the scope modifier.
There's three as far as I know:

Public

Public scoped things are accessible by EVERYTHING. Anything inside, outside, or derived from the source can see, reference and change it.

So if in Script A I say:

	public int Mario = 10;

Then in Script B I can say

	Mario += 10;

And it'll work.

Private

Private scoped things are accessible by ONLY the thing it's defined in. Even derived things can't see it.

So if in Script A I say:

	private int Luigi = 5;

In Script B, I can't even see it in autocomplete. It doesn't exist outside of Script A.

Protected

Protected things are accessible only in the thing it's defined in and its derivatives.

So if in Script A I say:

	protected int Waluigi = 9999;

Then in any derivative of Script A I can say:

	Waluigi += 1337;

And it'll work.

But it won't work in Script B or Script C, only derivatives of Script A.
