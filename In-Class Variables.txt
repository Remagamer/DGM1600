//Variables are containers for different kinds of information.

//If I wanted to store something...like

 public string Name;

//A name I would use that.

//Then I can use it in something like this...

 print("My name is" + Name);

//And it would print "My name is JEFF", supposing I set the name to JEFF.

//But if we want to use numbers...

//We need to use

 public int FoodCount

//Which is a whole number. It's useful!

//We can use it in the same way as a String.

 print("I have this much food:" + FoodCount);

//And that would print "I have this much food:345", supposing I set the FoodCount to 345.

//But if we want a number like 34.5, we need to use Floats.

//Floats are more expensive to use but can hold more complicated numbers than Ints.

//And that's my understanding of variables!
