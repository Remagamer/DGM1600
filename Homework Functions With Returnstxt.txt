Homework Functions With Return.

The deal with functions that have a return is that a function can return a value to whatever called it.

so I could say...

	HowManyMarios()
	{
		//check how many marios there are.
		return marioCount;
	}

And then I could say...

	int marioCount = HowManyMarios();

...and that would count the amount of Marios.

It's like magic.
