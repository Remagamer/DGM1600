An if statement is a thing that says if this is true, do this. But an else statement is basically an addon to that that makes it into 
"If this is true, do this. If it's not, do this instead."

for instance...

		if(Name == "Cat") {
			print("Meow!");
		}
		else
		{
			print("I am not a cat.");	
		}
Or...

		if(Name == "Dog") {
			print("Bark!");
		}
		else
		{
			print("I am not a dog.");	
		}
You could use it to count food, too.


		if(FoodCount == 0) {
			print("I have no food!");
		}
		else
		{
			print("I have this much food:" + FoodCount);	
		}

Or measure health.

		if(Health == 0) {
			print("You're dead as a dead guy, dead guy.");
		}
		else
		{
			print("Everything is A-OK!");	
		}
Or even add in a password!

		if(Password == "hunter2") {
			print("You got a secret!");
		}
		else
		{
			print("You get NOTHING!");	
		}

So else statements can be very useful.
