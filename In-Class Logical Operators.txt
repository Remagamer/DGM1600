So logical operators are basically additional conditions you can add.

so if I want something to test for 2 things...

I can say...

if x equals something AND y equals something...

or...

if x equals something AND y equals something AND z equals something...

So it's a way of testing multiple things in an if.

Now there's another kind. Say I want something to happen if this OR that.

I can say...

if x equals something+1 OR x equals something-1 ...

then it'll do something if either of those are true.

you can combine these for different effects.


The AND is & while the OR is |.

There is also a conditional || that only evaluates operands until one is found true.
