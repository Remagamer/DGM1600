In Class Arrays

So arrays are basically a lot of a variable type.

I could go...

public Int 1 = 1;
public Int 2 = 1;
public Int 3 = 1;

...and so on and so forth.

But that's no good when I could go...

public int[] Ints;

and set the size to whatever I want and then it's done. Just like that.
