Homework: Switch Statements

So here's the deal with switches. Switches let me do a whole lot with very little.

Say I have a cheat code system and I want to compare my input to a lot of things.
I can say...

If (Code == "Noclip") {
	//activate noclip
}
If (Code == "All Beans") {
	//activate all beans
}
If (Code == "Mario 2") {
	//Mario 2
}

...and so on and so forth. but that's inefficient when compared to switches. with switches I can say...

switch (Code)
{
	case "Noclip":
		//activate noclip
		break;
	case "All Beans":
		//activate all beans
		break;
	case "Mario 2":
		//Mario 2
		break;
}

And it'll do these comparisons much faster with less work! You should always use switches if you're lining up more than a few ifs.
