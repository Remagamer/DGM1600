Homework: For Loops

For Loops are neato. They let you pass something into the loop and iterate on it every loop,
And they're a big part of making games.
For instance, I could say...

for(int i = 0; i < Marios; i++)
{
	//Do the mario!
}

And that would Do The Mario as long as the "i" is smaller than the Marios. you could use it
to iterate on every item in a list, doing something based on that. It's really cool.
