Homework: Lists

Lists are basically arrays but more flexible.

with an array you need to say...

public Int[] ArrayOfInts;

but with a list you need to say...

public List<int> ListOfInts;

And you can use lists for more than you can use arrays because of the flexibility of dealing with them.

Arrays are less versatile.
